### AWS Setup

### Rust Example
> To execute one of the exemples you must configure your AWS IoT Core following the [AWS Setup](#aws-setup) step.

- Before everting configured you need to able to compile Rust applications, to do that you can following the [oficial Rust installation guid](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)

- To run the exemplo you will need to configure the [Makefile](https://github.com/tointernet/aws.iot.core.and.paho.client/blob/main/Makefile) with your own configurations

- With everting setup just execute:

```
make run-rust
```

- The exemplo code can be find [here](https://github.com/tointernet/aws.iot.core.and.paho.client/tree/main/rust)

### GoLang Exemple
> To execute one of the exemples you must configure your AWS IoT Core following the [AWS Setup](#aws-setup) step.

- Before everting configured you need to able to compile GoLang applications, to do that you can following the [oficial GoLang installation guid](https://go.dev/learn/)

- To run the exemplo you will need to configure the [Makefile](https://github.com/tointernet/aws.iot.core.and.paho.client/blob/main/Makefile) with your own configurations

- With everting setup just execute:

```
make run-go
```

- The exemplo code can be find [here](https://github.com/tointernet/aws.iot.core.and.paho.client/tree/main/golang)
